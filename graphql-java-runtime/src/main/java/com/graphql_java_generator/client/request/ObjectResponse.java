/**
 * This class describes what response is expected from the GraphQL server. That is: the fields and sub-objects that the
 * response from the GraphQL server should contain, for one GraphQL type. <BR/>
 * The structure is recursive: a {@link ObjectResponse} itsled contains one or more {@link ObjectResponse}, to describe
 * the Sub-object(s) that should be returned.<BR/>
 * A {@link ObjectResponse} can not be created directly. You must use an {@link Builder} to create a
 * {@link ObjectResponse}. This {@link Builder} allows to easily add fields, which can be scalars or sub-objects. And it
 * validates for each the GraphQL schema is respected.<BR/>
 * There are two types of {@link ObjectResponse}:
 * <UL>
 * <LI><B>Query {@link ObjectResponse}</B>: a query ResponsDef is returned by the generated code. For instance, if your
 * schema contains a QueryType type, a QueryType object will be generated. For each query in the GraphQL schema, this
 * QueryType object contains two methods: a getter which returns the {@link Builder} for this query, and the method wich
 * actually do the call to the GraphQL server for this query.</LI>
 * <LI><B>Sub-object {@link ObjectResponse}</B>: such a {@link ObjectResponse} allow you to define what's expected for a
 * field that is actually an object. This field is a sub-object of the object owning this field. To link such a
 * {@link ObjectResponse}, you'll use the {@link Builder#withSubObject(String, ObjectResponse)} or the
 * {@link Builder#withSubObject(String, String, ObjectResponse)} method.</LI>
 * </UL>
 * <BR/>
 * <BR/>
 * <H2>How to use the {@link Builder}</H2><BR/>
 * You'll first get a {@link ObjectResponse} from the generated QueryType (or whatever name you have in your GraphQL
 * schema for the query object), and its method getXxxxResponseDef, where Xxxx is the name of the query into the
 * QueryType.<BR/>
 * On this {@link Builder}, you can call:
 * <UL>
 * <LI><B>One of the withField methods</B> to add a scalar field to the expected response</LI>
 * <LI><B>One of the withEntity methods</B> to add a field whose type is not scalar. That is, to add a field whose type
 * is an object defined in the GraphQL schema. The withEntity methods needs a {@link ObjectResponse}. To get this
 * {@link ObjectResponse}, you'll create a {@link Builder} with one of the newSubObjectResponseDefBuilder methods.</LI>
 * </UL>
